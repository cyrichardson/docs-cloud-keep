# Rackspace Cloud Keep API documentation

This repository contains the source files that generate the following Cloud Keep API documentation:

* [Getting started](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-keep/v1/getting-started)
* [Release notes](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-keep/v1/release-notes/)
* [API Reference](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-keep/v1/api-reference/)

When you commit changes to the master branch of this repository, the

builds the documentation. Successful builds are deployed to production.
