Follow these steps to authenticate to the Rackspace Cloud by
:ref:`using cURL<how-curl-commands-work>`:

- :ref:`Send an authentication request<send-auth-req-curl>`
- :ref:`Review the authentication response<review-auth-resp>`
- :ref:`Configure environment variables <configure-environment-variables>`


.. _send-auth-req-curl:

Send an authentication request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From a command prompt, send a **POST tokens** request to the Rackspace Cloud Identity
service.  Include your username and :ref:`API key<get-credentials>`
as shown in the following example.

**Example: Authentication request**

.. include:: ../common-gs/samples/auth-req-curl.rst


.. _review-auth-resp:

Review the authentication response
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If your credentials are valid, the Identity service returns an authentication response
that includes the following information:

- An authentication token
- A service catalog with information about the services that you can access
- User information and role assignments

.. note:: 
     For detailed information about the authentication response, see 
     :rax-devdocs:`Annotated authentication request and response<cloud-identity/v2/developer-guide/#document-authentication-info/sample-auth-req-response>` 
     in the Rackspace Cloud Identity documentation.


In the following example response, the ellipsis (...)  represents other service endpoints, which
are not shown. The values shown in this and other examples vary because the information
returned is specific to your account.


**Example: Authentication response**

.. include:: ../common-gs/samples/auth-resp-json.rst


If the request was successful, you can find the authentication token and other information in the
authentication response. You'll need these values to submit requests to the API. See
:ref:`Configure environment variables<configure-environment-variables>`.

If the request failed, review the response message and
the following error message descriptions to determine next steps.

If you see the following message, review the authentication request for syntax or coding 
errors. If you are using cURL, see the section on :ref:`using cURL <how-curl-commands-work>`.

.. code:: 

   400 Invalid request body: unable to parse Auth data. Please review XML or JSON formatting

If you see the following message, verify the authentication credentials
submitted in the authentication request. If necessary, contact your Rackspace Cloud Administrator or
Rackspace Support to get valid credentials. 

.. code::

   401 Unable to authenticate user with credentials provided.

If you see the following message, verify that your user has the correct service catalog entries and/or
roles to access the service. If necessary, contact your Rackspace Cloud Administrator or 
Rackspace Support to verify your authorization.

.. code::
   
   403 Forbidden. Not Authorized.
   
   
..  note::
       For more information about authentication and authorization errors, see the
       :rax-devdocs:`Cloud Identity API Reference documentation <cloud-identity/v2/developer-guide/#document-api-operations/token-operations>`.


.. _configure-environment-variables:

Configure environment variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The authentication response returns the following values that you
need to include when you make service requests to the |apiservice|.


token ID
    The authentication token ID value is required to confirm your identity each time you access the service.
    You include it in the ``X-Auth-Token`` header for each API request.

    The ``expires`` attribute indicates the date and time that the token will expire,
    unless it is revoked prior to the
    expiration. To get a new token, submit another authentication request. For more
    information, see
    :rax-devdocs:`Manage tokens and token expiration
    <cloud-identity/v2/developer-guide/#manage-authentication-tokens>`.

tenant ID
    The tenant ID value provides your account number. For most Rackspace Cloud service APIs, the
    tenant ID is appended to the API endpoint in the service catalog automatically.

endpoints
	 The endpoints object provides the URLs that you can use to access the API service. 
	 For guidance on choosing an endpoint, see :ref:`Service access<service-access-endpoints>`.


To make it easier to include these and other values in API requests, use the ``export`` 
command to create environment variables that can be substituted for the actual values. 
For example, you can create an ``API_ENDPOINT`` variable to store the URL for accessing 
an API service. To reference the value in an API request, prefix the variable name with a $, 
for example ``ENDPOINT``.


.. include:: ../common-gs/using-env-variables.rst

**Create environment variables**

#. In the ``token`` section of the authentication response, copy the token ``id`` and
   tenant ``id`` values from the token object. The following example shows example values 
   only.

      .. include:: ../common-gs/samples/auth-token-object.rst

#. Export the token ID to an environment variable
   that can be supplied in the ``X-Auth-Token`` header required in each
   API request.  Replace *token-id* with the authentication token ``id`` value returned
   in the authentication response.

   .. code::

       $ export AUTH_TOKEN="token-id"


#. Export the tenant ID to an environment variable
   that can be supplied in requests that require you to specify a tenant ID or tenant name.
   Replace *tenant-id* with the authentication token ``tenant id`` value returned
   in the authentication response.

   .. code::

       $ export TENANT_ID="tenant-id"


#. In the ``service catalog`` section of the authentication response, copy the ``publicURL``
   value for the |apiservice|, version, and region that you want to access.

   The following example shows the endpoint available for the |apiservice|.

   .. include:: ../common-gs/samples/service-catalog-endpoint.rst
   
   
   .. note:: 
        For some services, the ``publicURL`` value for |apiservice| consists of the service access endpoint 
        URL with the tenant ID for your account appended after the ``/``. 


#. Export the URL to an environment variable, as shown in the following example. Replace 
   Replace *publicURL* with the ``publicURL`` value listed in the service catalog.

   .. code::

        $ export ENDPOINT="publicURL"
