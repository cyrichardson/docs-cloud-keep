Cloud Keep is a REST API that enables secure life-cycle management of keys
and credentials, called *secrets*, on behalf of customers. This is
especially important for customers who want to securely store and
retrieve credentials systematically, and enables customers to have keys
generated on their behalf based on their requested encryption algorithm
and bit length.

This guide provides an introduction into the Cloud Keep API and
explains how to perform basic API calls. You'll learn how to authenticate, send API requests,
and complete basic operations with Cloud Keep API.

For additional details
about all of the API operations, see the :ref:`API reference <api-reference>`.
