Limits
~~~~~~~~

All accounts are configured with default thresholds, or limits, that
manage capacity and prevent abuse of the system.

Rate limits control the frequency at which the user can issue specific
API requests.

For |product name|, the rate limit is 600 requests per minute.

..  note::
    If the default limits are too low for your particular application,
    contact Rackspace Cloud support to request an increase. All requests
    require reasonable justification.
