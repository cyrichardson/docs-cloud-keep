Response codes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |product name| REST API returns an HTTP response code that denotes the success
or failure of the call.

-  Successful response codes are returned only if all configured
   providers were successful in processing the request.

-  Error response codes are accompanied by an ``application/json``
   response body that contains the error messages.

The following table lists possible responses with their associated codes
and descriptions.

|                     |               | For example, it might be down for       |
|                     |               | scheduled platform maintenance. Try     |
|                     |               | again later.                            |
