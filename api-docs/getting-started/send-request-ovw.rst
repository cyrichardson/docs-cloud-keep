Send requests to the API
------------------------------------------

This Getting Started Guide shows how to send requests by using cURL.

.. note::
     You can also use Rackspace Cloud API services by using the following methods:

     -  If you are developing applications or automation, try using the
        `OpenStack python-barbicanclient`_ library.

     -  For API development, testing and workflow management in a graphical environment, try
        interacting with the API by using an application such as
        `Postman`_  or `RESTClient for Firefox`_.
