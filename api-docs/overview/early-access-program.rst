Early Access Program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Rackspace Cloud Keep API is now available to customers through an
Early Access program. As the service progresses towards General
Availability, additional features and event notifications will be added,
and it is possible that existing implementations and formats might
change. 

The Early Access program is an opportunity for customers to work
in partnership with Rackspace to ensure that the implemented features
align with business needs and can be used with maximum efficiency.

Visit the [Cloud Keep Sign up](http://go.rackspace.com/cloud-keep.html) for details. 


.. note: 
  
    The Early Access program is provided to customers subject to the Test Terms located at
    http://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/cloud/tos.
