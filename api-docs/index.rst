=============================================================

*Last updated:* |today|

Rackspace Cloud Keep is a REST API that enables secure life-cycle
management of keys and credentials, called secrets, on behalf of
customers. This is especially important for customers who want to
securely store and retrieve credentials systematically, and enables
customers to have keys generated on their behalf based on their
requested encryption algorithm and bit length.
