## Project description

This project is developed and built by using the 
[Python Sphinx documentation generator](http://sphinx-doc.org/). Content is 
written in [reStructuredText](http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html), which is the markup syntax and 
parser component of [Python Docutils](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/index.html).

Source files for the Sphinx documentation project are in the ``api-docs`` directory. 
Following are the key files that define project and content architecture: 

Content | File

|Index page for the main content structure| [index.rst](https://github.com/rackerlabs/docs-barbican/blob/master/api-docs/index.rst)

described in detail in [Style guidelines for technical content](https://github.com/rackerlabs/docs-rackspace/tree/master/style-guide):

- Use [sentence-style capitalization](https://github.com/rackerlabs/docs-rackspace/blob/master/style-guide/a-l-style-guidelines.md#cap-sentence-style) for titles and headings
- Use consistent [text formatting](https://github.com/rackerlabs/docs-rackspace/blob/master/style-guide/m-z-style-guidelines.md#text-formatting)
- Write clear and consistent [code examples](https://github.com/rackerlabs/docs-rackspace/blob/master/style-guide/a-l-style-guidelines.md#code-examples)
- Use [active voice](https://github.com/rackerlabs/docs-rackspace/blob/master/style-guide/basic-writing-guidelines.md#use-active-voice)
- Use [present tense](https://github.com/rackerlabs/docs-rackspace/blob/master/style-guide/basic-writing-guidelines.md#use-present-tense)
- Write to the user by using [second person and imperative mood](https://github.com/rackerlabs/docs-rackspace/blob/master/style-guide/basic-writing-guidelines.md#write-to-user)

# Submitting your changes

When you've completed your changes, submit a pull request. Someone on the Information Development team will review your PR.
- Minor updates and corrections get a quick review to ensure that content is error-free and doesn't introduce other issues.
- More complex changes or additions require both technical and editorial review. 

Depending on the review feedback, you might be asked to make additional changes. 

After content has been reviewed and approved, the updates can be merged to the master branch. The merge triggers the build and 
deploy process. Typically, new content is available on developer.rackspace.com within a minute or two after it is merged. Larger 
updates might take a bit longer.

## Previewing changes

If you want to preview your changes in the context of the entire project, use either of the following methods to build a local copy of the Sphinx documentation project.

- Install and run the [Sphinx documentation generator](http://sphinx-doc.org/) to build 
  the project locally with the [Read the Docs theme](http://docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/theme.html). See the following instructions.
- Install and run the [deconst client](https://github.com/deconst/client) to build the 
  project with the Rackspace-branded theme. This build creates content that looks the 
  same as the content delivered on developer.rackspace.com. See 
  [instructions for building with the client](https://github.com/rackerlabs/docs-migration/blob/master/docs/migration-instructions.rst#building-your-project-with-the-local-deconst-client).
 

### Build the project with Sphinx

Use these instructions to install and run the Sphinx documentation generator to build the project locally with the Read the Docs theme. 

#### Prerequisites

- Python 2.7 or later
- Mac OS X: Install [virtualenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) or [pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv)
- Windows: 
[Install Python, pip, and virtualenv with PowerShell](http://www.tylerbutler.com/2012/05/how-to-install-python-pip-and-virtualenv-on-windows-with-powershell/).


#### Set up your build environment

1. Run the following command to activate your virtual environment:

   ```
    bin activate env-name
    
   ```   

2. In the root directory for the project, run the following commands to install Sphinx 
   and other required packages:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    ```
    
#### Build the project

To build the documentation project, run the following commands:

    cd api-docs
    make clean singlehtml

These commands generate a single page HTML document with a navigation bar on the right.

#### View the HTML build results

To open the generated project, run the following command: 

    open _build/html/index.html
