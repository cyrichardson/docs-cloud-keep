Limits
~~~~~~~~

All accounts are configured with default thresholds, or limits, that
manage capacity and prevent abuse of the system.

Rate limits control the frequency at which the user can issue specific
API requests.

For Cloud Keep, the rate limit is 1000 requests per minute.

Rate limits are reset after a certain amount of time passes. For Cloud
Metrics, the rate limit is per minute.

..  note::
    If the default limits are too low for your particular application,
    contact Rackspace Cloud support to request an increase. All requests
    require reasonable justification.
